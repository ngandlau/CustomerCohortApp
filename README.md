# CustomerCohortApp

Shiny application for simulating how a firm develops over time, cohort by cohort. 
 
For example, you can choose how many customers the firm acquires and how much each customer spends.

The app then allows to explore the firm's (customer-based) valuation at different points in time, exploring how every metric can be broken down by customer cohorts, and exploring how typical SaaS metrics (e.g. Payback Period, Net Revenue Retention Rate, Quick Ratio) develop over the firm's lifecycle.
